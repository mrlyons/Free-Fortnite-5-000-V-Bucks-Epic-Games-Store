- **Edit Structures**: Learn to edit your builds for quick escapes or to surprise opponents.

### Weapons and Items

Fortnite features a wide variety of weapons, from assault rifles to shotguns. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon can give you a competitive edge. Here are some weapon tips:
